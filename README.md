In this Code, I used a Language-agnostic BERT Sentence Encoder.

Language-agnostic BERT Sentence Encoder (LaBSE)  is a BERT-based model trained for sentence embedding for 109 languages. The pre-training process combines masked language modeling with translation language modeling. The model is useful for getting multilingual sentence embeddings and for bi-text retrieval.
